# nerc_analysis
This repository analyzes climate impacts on energy systems for the NERC project.

## Input Files
The input data needed to recreate this analysis is stored in the [data](data/) directory.

## Summary Plots
Quick-look plots analyzing the data are stored in the [plots](plots/) directory.

## Ideas to Expand Analysis
1. Area-weight instead of raw averaging across counties
2. Use wet-bulb instead of dry-bulb temperature
3. Check for population-weighting impact on cold snaps
4. Check PJM and other large BAs
5. Analyze how the shape of heat waves varies across BAs

## Key Results
* TBD
